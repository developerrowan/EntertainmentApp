# EntertainmentApp
Final project for Web Development with ASP.NET @ Western Technical College, and, consequently, one of two final projects for my associate's degree

## What is it?
This is an IMDB clone, written in ASP.NET and Angular. It uses Bootstrap and Bootstrap icons for theming.

It's not the most beautiful app, nor the most responsive. But I'm proud of it - especially the details page for each
movie / show.

I deviated from the project requirements slightly in a couple of places, but feel I was able to make up for it in other ways,
such as the calculation system for displaying the average vote count out of 5 stars.
